            At Redeemer, education is about understanding a complex global world, thinking critically from a kingdom perspective, and following Christâ€™s call to transform culture and communities. Rooted in a distinctly Christ-centred Core Curriculum, a degree in one of 34 majors and streams offers experiential learning opportunities and a cross-functional set of knowledge. Wrapped in a spiritually vibrant campus community, your education will provide invaluable skills and prepare you for a rapidly changing future, wherever God calls you.
